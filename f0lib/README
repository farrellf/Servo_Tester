F0LIB is my collection of any remotely reuseable code for the STM32F0. It's not yet ready for sharing but since it was used in this project I'm including the code. It's not very clean, efficient or thoroughly tested. Use with caution.

The library is broken up into several pieces:

f0lib_accel_magn_lsm303dlhc
	For the STM LSM303DLHC 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis magnetometer.

f0lib_adc
	For the built-in ADC

f0lib_converters
	Basic functions for converting between different data formats

f0lib_debug
	Basic wrapper functions to allow for quickly enabling or disabling debug code

f0lib_exti
	For the built-in interrupts

f0lib_gpio
	For enabling and configuring GPIOs

f0lib_gyro_l3gd20
	For the STM L3GD20 3-axis gyro

f0lib_i2c
	For the built-in I2C interface

f0lib_rf_cc2500
	For the TI CC2500 2.4GHz RF chip

f0lib_rs232
	For configuring a USART for RS232 usage

f0lib_spi
	For the built-in SPI interface

f0lib_timers
	For the built-in timers
